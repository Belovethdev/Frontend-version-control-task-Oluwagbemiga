# Frontend Version Control Task – Oluwagbemiga

## 🧠 Project Overview
A simple “BeSmart Demo” webpage demonstrating my understanding of version control using Git and GitHub.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goal of this task is to:

* Initialize and manage a Git repository.
* Work with feature branches.
* Make and document meaningful commits.
* Create and merge pull requests.
* Revert commits and rename branches.
* Demonstrate real-world version control collaboration practices.

## 🔧 Branches
- `feature-header`: Added navbar and hero layout.
- `feature-footer`: Built responsive footer section.

## 🔁 Git Commands Used
- `git init`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m ""`
- `git checkout -b branchname`
- `git push origin branchname`
- `git merge`
- `git push -u origin`
- `git revert`
- `git branch -m`
